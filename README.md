Decentralised system of banking for fund raising

Decentralised application on the Ethereum Network uses blockchain technology, and its major goal is to increase transparency. Blockchain is used to preserve records of user contributions, which will decentralise banking for fund-raising and prevent bank money fraud. All banking transactions will be handled by a single central smart contract. Anyone can use the contract to launch a campaign to raise money for their firm. The contributors have the option to send funds to the smart contract we'll be deploying The campaign creator or manager will then ask the smart contract to generate a request to transfer the necessary amounts to the chosen vendor. Each contributor accepts the created request and any resulting consensus. The manager of the raised request can finalize the request and the transaction takes place from the contract to the vendors if the number of approvals is greater than half of the total contributors or donators. This will lessen fraud and contribute to the delivery of a reliable banking system. There will be a check for each request for the transfer of money from a smart contract to the vendors, and the funds cannot be utilized for one's own requirements.
